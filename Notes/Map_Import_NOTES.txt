break/avoid iso-cycles somehow (overlap & double/triple/etc-draw has too many edge cases)

TODO:
- determine the EoE tile numbers from tmx file (ie which numbers to skip/compress)
- copy/paste the layers and pull the numbers into an eoe .emap file using my utilitiy

- split each tilesheet using unity
- pull the meta files using my utility

- give each tileset renderblocks and colliders (if any) (w/offsets) (in a master tileset file)
- load the new map
