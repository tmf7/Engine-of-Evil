--Engine of Evil--

Project initially created using Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2015 for Windows Desktop,
as well as Simple Directmedia layer 2.0.3 and a few of its extensions.

Master branch represents an initial commit of rough work. 
It only includes my original source and the free-use graphics and font images.

To get the program running:
1) Pull or clone this repository
2) Create a new project with your IDE of choice
3) Follow the instructions for downloading and including SDL2 in your project at https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php
4) Follow the instructions for downloading and including SDL_ttf in your project at https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/
	
Notes: 
-> SDL_ttf is used as a font handling extension to SDL2 
-> My initial builds used the dynamically linked libraries provided by SDL and SDL_ttf for the compiled executable
-> The static libraries and additional headers provided by SDL and SDL_ttf were resources use to complie the project
