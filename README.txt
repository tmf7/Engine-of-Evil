--Engine of Evil--

Project initially created using Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2015 for Windows Desktop,
as well as Simple Directmedia layer 2.0.3 and a few of its extensions.

Master branch tracks the current stable build.
Updates branch tracks changes in progress (not necessarily a stable build)
Both include my original source code and assets used.

To get the program running:
1) Pull or clone this repository
2) Create a new project with your IDE of choice
3) Follow the instructions for downloading and including SDL2, SDL_ttf, and SDL_image in your project at:
https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php
https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/
https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
respectively.
	
Notes: 
-> SDL_ttf is used as a font handling extension to SDL2
-> SDL_Image is used to load image file types beyond bitmaps
